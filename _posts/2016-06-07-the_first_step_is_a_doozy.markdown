Titles are the toughest part, aren't they? I must have stared at my screen for 15 minutes before copping out with the above. But you have to start somewhere, so there it is and here I go.

First, an explanation of my blog's title, which also doubles as my [GitHub handle](http://github.com/vicision). "Vicision" is a neologism/portmanteau (yes, I'm a nerd) that I coined years ago after coming across the term [vicissitude](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vicissitude), which Merriam-Webster defines as:

Anyway, I decided to take the root of the word and make it my own, adding a more positive spin to the idea of change (after all, life is growth, and growth is change, so there is no life without change!). That's where the double meaning comes in, with the portmanteau of **vision** and **decision**. It's oversimplifying things a bit, but I think it's pretty accurate to say that those are two of the most important steps in effecting any positive change: first you have to imagine the change you want, then you have to act on it and decide to pursue it. 

Which all makes **vicision** an apt title for my blog: I decided to change my life completely from the path I was on and learn to be a web developer through The Flatiron School's Learn-verified program. 

It wasn't an easy decision to make, but it was a necessary one. I was recently downsized out of a graphic design job that I'd held at a major comic book company for over 6 years, and felt that it was time to take my life and career in a new direction. 

As I wrote in my application essay to the Learn program, I'm very driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how everything works--the "hows" and "whys" of the world. Increasingly, the answers to those questions lie in code. Having worked as a graphic designer for years, I’m also a creative person who is very detail-oriented, so building something new and making it work “just right” is extremely appealing to me. 

I've always had a fascination with technology as well, a trait probably inherited from my grandfathers--one of them was a self-taught machinist and the other a repairer of electronics who could fix nearly any device, even if he'd never used it before (and without the internet!). Naturally, my interest in technology and curiosity about how things work (coupled with a bit of an anti-authoritarian streak that made hacker culture appealing to me) led me to an interest in programming. 

I'd lightly dabbled in learning some code previously (and had a familiarity with HTML and CSS), but had never had the time to devote to pursuing it as a career. Well, now I do--while it could have been a negative experience, instead my layoff was a blessing in disguise, as it gave me the opportunity to pursue learning programming and in turn, pursue a new and rewarding career doing something I'm learning to love more every day
